# FireFightingRobotWithObstacleDetection
This project is an autonomous Firefighting Robot designed as part of the Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering (FEE) project for 1st Semester students at Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. The robot is capable of navigating an area, detecting fire, and extinguishing it using a water pump system. It employs ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and fire sensors to identify fire sources, with a servo-controlled nozzle ensuring efficient water spraying.
