# FireFightingRobotWithObstacleDetection
This project is an autonomous Firefighting Robot designed to navigate a space, detect fire, and extinguish it using a water pump system. The robot uses ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and fire sensors to identify fire sources. A servo-controlled nozzle ensures efficient water spraying to put out the fire.
